*Add section with overview on quotas and qtrees*

>> Exporting data and client access MOVES TO THE TWO CREATE/ACCESS TOPICS

>> Review volume create (more options) and edit to get a list of the configuration options to describe

>> For example, have two options (data protection and high throughput), describe what these mean

== Storage terminology and options

NFS trunking::
NFS trunking is a technology that enables NFS v4.1 clients to open multiple connections to different LIFs on the NFS server. This increases the data transfer speed and provide resilience through multi-pathing. Trunking is beneficial for exporting FlexVol volumes to trunking-capable clients.

== Storage limits

There are several storage limits enforced by ONTAP AFX. These include:

xxx

== Client authentication and authorization options

>> Move to secure data section in SB? Separate topic?

>> intro, overview

>> link to UOD if needed

>> Create users?

== ONTAP AFX support for NFS trunking

xxx

>> To enable trunking, you need to have an SVM configured for NFS, and NFSv4.1 should be enabled. It requires remounting all NFSv4.x clients, which can be disruptive.
