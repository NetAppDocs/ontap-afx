[.lead]
You can manage the networking of your ONTAP AFX storage system. After adding or creating network resources, you can perform additional administration tasks. System Manager provides a robust set of options that you can explore to learn more about ONTAP AFX configuration.

[TIP]
Links to the unified ONTAP documentation are provided for additional details where appropriate. Also see link:../administer/manage-ethernet-ports.html[Manage ONTAP AFX Ethernet ports] for related networking configuration.

== Add an IPspace

IPspaces allow a single cluster to be accessed by clients in separately administered network domains. This provides isolation of the client traffic to ensure security and data privacy.

.Steps

.  In System Manager, select *Network* and then *Overview*.
. Under *IPspaces*, select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters].
. Provide the name of the IPspace or accept the default.
+
All IPspace names must be unique within a cluster.
. Select *Save*.

== Add a network interface

A logical network interface provides the network access for clients as well as cluster management traffic.

.  In System Manager, select *Network* and then *Overview*.
. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters] under the tab *Network interfaces*.
. Select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters].
. Provide the configuration details, including the interface type, supported protocols, and name.
. Select *Save*.

== Add a subnet

Subnetworks provide a logical division of the IP address space in your network. You can define subnets and use them when adding the logicl network interfaces.

.  In System Manager, select *Network* and then *Overview*.
. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters] under the tab *Subnets*.
. Select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters].
. Provide the configuration details, including the name, IP address details, and broadcast domain.
. Select *Save*.
