= Manage ONTAP AFX cluster networking

[.lead]
You can manage the networking of your ONTAP AFX storage system. In addition to adding or creating network resources, you can perform additional administration tasks. System Manager provides a robust set of options you can explore to learn more about ONTAP AFX network configuration. You need to be a cluster administrator to perform the ONTAP AFX network configuration.

[TIP]
Links to the unified ONTAP documentation are provided where appropriate for additional details. Also see link:../administer/manage-ethernet-ports.html[Manage ONTAP AFX Ethernet ports] for related networking administration.

== Create an IPspace

An IPspace is an administrative domain for IP addresses and related network configuration. These spaces can be used to support your SVMs through isolated administration and routing. For example, they are useful when clients use overlapping IP addresses from the same IP address and subnet range.

[TIP]
You must create an IPspace before you can create a subnet.

.Steps

.  In System Manager, select *Network* and then *Overview*.
. Under *IPspaces*, select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters].
. Provide the name of the IPspace or accept the default.
+
All IPspace names must be unique within a cluster.
. Select *Save*.

.What's next

You can use the IPspace to create a subnet.

== Create a subnet

A subnetwork enforces a logical division of the IP address space in your network. It enables you to allocate dedicated blocks of IP addresses for the creation of a network interface (LIF). Subnet simplify LIF creation by allowing you to specify the subnet name instead of a specific IP address and network mask.

.Before you begin

You must create a broadcast domain and IPspace where the subnet will be defined. Also note the following:

* All subnet names must be unique within a specific IPspace.
* The IP address range used for a subnet cannot overlap with the IP addresses of other subnets.

.Steps

.  In System Manager, select *Network* and then *Overview*.
. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters] under the *Subnets* tab.
. Select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters].
. Provide the configuration details, including the name, IP address details, and broadcast domain.
. Select *Save*.

.What's next

The new subnet will simplify the creation of your network interfaces.

== Create a network interface

A logical network interface (LIF) consists of an IP address and related network configuration. It can be associated with a physical or logical port and is typically used by the clients to access data provided by an SVM. LIFs provide resiliency in the event of a failure and can migrate among the node ports so communication is not interrupted.

.Steps

.  In System Manager, select *Network* and then *Overview*.
. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters] under the tab *Network interfaces*.
. Select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters].
. Provide the configuration details, including the interface type, supported protocols, and name.
. Select *Save*.
