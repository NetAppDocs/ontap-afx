[.lead]
You can perform network administration of your ONTAP AFX storage system, such as adding a broadcast domain or creating a network interface. For each of the ONTAP resources, there are additional configuration options such as editing and deleting objects. You should explore the System Manager user interface to learn more about ONTAP AFX network configuration.

[TIP]
Links to the unified ONTAP documentation are provided for additional information where appropriate.

== Add a broadcast domain

A broadcast domain simplifies management of your cluster network by grouping ports that are part of the same layer 2 network. The storage virtual machines (SVMs) can then be assigned ports in the group for data or management traffic.

There are several broadcast domains created during cluster setup, including:

Default::
This broadcast domain contains ports in the “Default” IPspace. These ports are used primarily to serve data. Cluster management and node management ports are also in this broadcast domain.
Cluster::
This broadcast domain contains ports in the “Cluster” IPspace. These ports are used for cluster communication and include all cluster ports from all nodes in the cluster.

You can also create additional broadcast domains after your cluster has been initialized. When you create a broadcast domain, a failover group that contains the same ports is automatically created.

.About this task

The maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the ports added to a broadcast domain are updated to the MTU value set in the broadcast domain.

.Steps

.  In System Manager, select *Network* and then *Overview*.
. Under *Broadcast domains*, select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters].
. Provide a name for the broadcast domain or accept the default.
+
All broadcast domain names must be unique within an IPspace.
. Select the IPspace for the broadcast domain.
+
If you don’t specify an IPspace name, the broadcast domain is created in the "Default" IPspace.
. Enter the maximum transmission unit (MTU).
+
MTU is the largest data packet that can be accepted in your broadcast domain.
. Select the desired ports; then select *Save*.
