In addition to the typical AFX SVM administration, there may be other tasks you need to perform based on your environment. Most of the additional tasks can be performed using System Manager, although in some cases you may need to use the CLI.

[NOTE]
The ONTAP features and administration described are common to AFX storage systems and AFF or FAS systems running Unified ONTAP. Links to the relevant Unified ONTAP documentation are included as appropriate.

== Storage management and performance

There are several optional storage management and performance features you can configure and use with your AFX deployment.

=== ONTAP NAS storage management

Network Attached Storage (NAS) provides dedicated file storage which can be accessed by multiple clients in the network. ONTAP supports several NAS protocols. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/nas-management/index.html[NAS storage management^] for more information.

=== ONTAP FlexCache Volumes

FlexCache is an ONTAP remote caching feature. It brings data closer to clients which improves access performance and reduces costs. Creating a FlexCache volume, which initially copies only the metadata from the origin file system, simplifies file distribution and reduces WAN traffic See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/flexcache/index.html[Learn about ONTAP FlexCache volumes^] for more information.

=== ONTAP FlexGroup volumes

A FlexGroup volume consists of several member volumes that share the traffic automatically and transparently. FlexGroup volumes offer several benefits, including high performance and simplified management. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/flexgroup/creation-workflow-task.html[FlexGroup volume setup^] for more information.

== Data protection

There are several optional data protection features you can configure and use with your AFX deployment.

=== Consistency groups

A consistency group is a collection of volumes that are managed as a single unit. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/consistency-groups/index.html[Learn about ONTAP consistency groups^] for more information.

== ONTAP event and performance monitoring

You can monitor the health and performance of a cluster. This includes setting up alerts for events and managing notifications for system health alerts. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/event-performance-monitoring/index.html[Event, performance, and health monitoring^] for more information
