[.lead]
You can migrate a data SVM from one ONTAP cluster to another. You might do this to move and rebalance your applications or as part of a backup strategy. SVM migration with AFX operates the same as with Unified ONTAP, although there are several interoperability considerations. Refer to the Unified ONTAP documentation for the details about performing an SVM migration.

== Interoperability considerations

Before planning and performing an SVM migration, you should be aware of the capabilities and limitations.
