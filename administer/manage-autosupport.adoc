AutoSupport is a NetApp technology you can use to proactively monitor the health of your AFX storage systems. It can automatically send messages to NetApp technical support, your internal support organization, or a support partner.

AutoSupport is enabled by default when you set up an AFX cluster and messages will be send to NetApp technical support. To send messages to your internal support organization, you need to properly configure your cluster and provide a valid email host. AFX begins sending AutoSupport messages 24 hours after it is active.

[NOTE]
You need to sign in to System Manager using a cluster administrator account to manage AutoSupport.

== Test AutoSupport connectivity

After you have set up your cluster, you should test your AutoSupport connectivity to verify that technical support can receive the messages generated by AutoSupport.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. Next to *AutoSupport* select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots] and then *Test connectivity*.
. Enter a subject for the AutoSupport message and select *Send test AutoSupport message*.

== Add AutoSupport recipients

You can optionally add members of your internal support organization to the list of email addresses that receive AutoSupport messages.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. Next to *AutoSupport* select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots] and then *More options*.
. Next to *Email*, select image:icon_edit_pencil_blue_outline.png[pencil icon] and then image:icon_add.gif[blue plus sign followed by the word Add].
. Provide the email address for the recipient; for the recipient category, select:
+
* *Partner* for your partners
* *General* for members of your internal support organization
. Select *Save*.

.Result

The email addresses you have added will receive new AutoSupport messages for their specific recipient category.

== Send AutoSupport data

If a problem occurs with your AFX system, you should manually send the AutoSupport data. This can significantly decrease the amount of time it takes to identify and resolve the issue.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. Next to *AutoSupport* select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots] and then *Generate and send*.
. Provide a subject for the AutoSupport message.
. Select *Send*.

.Result

Your AutoSupport data is sent to technical support.

== Suppress support case generation

If you are performing an upgrade or maintenance on your AFX system, you might want to suppress the generation of AutoSupport support cases until your upgrade or maintenance is complete.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. Next to *AutoSupport* select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots] and then *Suppress support case generation*.
. Specify the number of hours to suppress the generation of support cases and the nodes you don't  want cases generated for.
. Select *Send*.

.Result

AutoSupport cases will not be generated during the time you specified.  If you complete your upgrade or maintenance before the specified time expires, you should resume support case generation immediately.

== Resume support case generation

If you have suppressed the generation of support cases during an upgrade or maintenance window, you should resume support case generation immediately after your upgrade or maintenance is complete.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. Next to *AutoSupport* select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots] and then *Resume support case generation*.
. Select the nodes for which you want to resume AutoSupport case generation.
. Select *Send*.

.Result

AutoSupport cases will be autogenerated for your AFX system as needed.
