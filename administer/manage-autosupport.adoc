[.lead]
AutoSupport is a NetApp technology you can use to proactively monitor the health of your ONTAP AFX storage systems. It can automatically send messages to NetApp technical support, your internal support organization, or a support partner.

AutoSupport is enabled by default when you set up an AFX cluster and messages will be send to NetApp technical support. To send messages to your internal support organization, you need to properly configure your cluster and provide a valid email host. ONTAP AFX begins sending AutoSupport messages 24 hours after it is active.

[NOTE]
You need to sign in to System Manager using a cluster administrator account to manage AutoSupport.

== Test AutoSupport connectivity

After you have set up your cluster, you should test your AutoSupport connectivity to verify that technical support can receive messages generated by AutoSupport.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. Next to *AutoSupport* select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots] and then select *Test connectivity*.
. Enter a subject for the AutoSupport message and select *Send test AutoSupport message*.

== Add AutoSupport recipients

Add members of your internal support organization to the list of email addresses that receive AutoSupport messages.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. Next to *AutoSupport* select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots] and then select *More options*.
. Next to *Email*, select image:icon_edit_pencil_blue_outline.png[pencil icon] and then select image:icon_add.gif[blue plus sign followed by the word Add].
. Enter the email address for the recipient and the recipient category.

For partners, select *Partner* for the recipient category.  Select *General* for members of your internal support organization.
. Select save.

.Result

The email addresses you have added will receive new AutoSupport messages for their specific recipient category.

== Send AutoSupport data

Should a problem occur on your ONTAP AFX system, AutoSupport data can significantly decrease the time it takes to identify and resolve issues.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. Next to *AutoSupport* select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots] and select *Generate and send*.
. Provide a subject for the AutoSupport message and select *Send*.

== Suppress support case generation

If you are performing an upgrade or maintenance on your ONTAP AFX system, you might want to suppress AutoSupport generation of support cases until your upgrade or maintenance is complete.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. Next to *AutoSupport* select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Suppress support case generation*.
. Specify the number of hours to suppress the generation of support cases and the nodes you don't  want cases generated.
. Select *Send*.

.Result

AutoSupport cases will not be generated during the time you specified.  If you complete your upgrade or maintenance before the specified time expires, you should resume support case generation immediately.

== Resume support case generation

If you have suppressed the generation of support cases during an upgrade or maintenance window, you should resume support case generation immediately after your upgrade or maintenance is complete.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then select *Settings*.
. Next to *AutoSupport* select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots] and then select *Resume support case generation*.
. Select the nodes for which you want to resume AutoSupport case generation.

AutoSupport cases are autogenerated for your ONTAP AFX system as needed.
