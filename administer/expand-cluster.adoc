[.lead]
You can expand the compute capability of an ONTAP AFX independent of the storage capacity. This can be a significant benefit as you adjust to the ongoing needs of your storage users.

.About this task

This procedure describes how to add two compute nodes to an existing cluster. You'll need to use both the ONTAP CLI as well as the System Manager interfaces.

.Before you begin

You need to have the credentials for a cluster administrator account and connect to the ONTAP CLI using SSH.

.Steps

. After connecting to the ONTAP CLI, set advanced privilege mode:
+
`afx> set advanced`

. Check the volume location of the current nodes; note the number of volumes per node:
+
`afx> vol show -fields node,size,constituent-count -is-constituent true -node *`
