= Expand the ONTAP AFX cluster node controllers

[.lead]
You can expand the compute capability of an ONTAP AFX cluster independent of the storage capacity. The expansion is performance without disruption. This is a significant benefit as you adjust to the ongoing needs of your storage users.

.About this task

This procedure describes how to add two compute nodes to an existing AFX cluster. You'll need to use both the ONTAP CLI and System Manager administrative interfaces.

.Before you begin

You need the credentials for a cluster administrator account and be able to connect to the ONTAP CLI using SSH.

.Steps

. After connecting to the ONTAP CLI, set the advanced privilege level:
+
`afx> set advanced`

. Check the volume locations of the current nodes; note the number of volumes per node:
+
`afx> vol show -fields node,size,constituent-count -is-constituent true -node *`

. Collect the cluster interconnect IP addresses and save them for use in later steps:
+
`afx> net int show -role cluster`

. Log into the service processor of the node or nodes you wish to add to the cluster.

. From the prompt, type *system console* to access the nodeâ€™s console.

. Boot the node to get to the boot menu prompt; if the menu does not load, use the *Ctrl+C* technique to access the boot menu.

. Select one of the boot options as appropriate; if prompted type *yes* to continue.

. Use the cluster setup wizard to configure a node management LIF, subnet, and gateway.
+
This will be used by System Manager to detect the node for addition into the cluster. Enter the configuration as prompted, including port, IP address, netmask, and default gateway.

. Press *CTL+C* to access the CLI.

. Modify the cluster interconnect addresses so they're routable in your network; use the configuration appropriate for your environment:
+
`afx> net int show -role cluster`
+
`afx> net int modify -vserver Cluster -lif clus1 -address 192.168.76.222`
+
`afx> net int modify -vserver Cluster -lif clus2 -address 192.168.76.226`

. Repeat the above steps on the other ONTAP AFX node controller.

.What's next?

You should monitor the updated cluster and continue to adjust the configuration as needed.
