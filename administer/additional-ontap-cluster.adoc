[.lead]
In addition to the common ONTAP AFX cluster administration tasks, there may be other tasks you need to perform based on your environment. Most of the additional tasks can be performed using System Manager, although in some cases you may need to use the CLI or REST API.

// Comment to reviewers:
[big red]*DP: This page is a catch all "bucket" for cluster administration topics that don't justify a dedicated page. I'll briefly describe the feature and link to at the Unified ONTAP doc. We expect this page to grow.*

== Security

There are several optional security features you can configure and use with your ONTAP AFX deployment.

=== OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 is the industry standard authorization framework used to restrict and control access to protected resources using signed access tokens.
