[.lead]
In addition to the typical AFX cluster administration tasks, there may be other tasks you need to perform based on your environment. Most of the additional tasks can be performed using System Manager, although in some cases you may need to use the CLI or REST API. Links to the relevant Unified ONTAP documentation are included.

[NOTE]
The features and administration topics described here are common to AFX storage systems and AFF or FAS systems running Unified ONTAP.

== Licensing

AFX systems are licensed in a similar way to Unified ONTAP AFF systems. An AFX cluster includes many features by default as appropriate for the protocols that are supported. You can install license files to activate additional features as needed.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. Next to *Licenses*, select image:icon_arrow.gif[blue arrow pointing to the right].
. Select the *Features* tab to display the available ONTAP features.
. To optionally install a licenses, select the *Installed licenses* tab.
. Select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters].
. Select a local license file and select *Add*.

== Security

There are several optional security features you can configure and use with your AFX deployment.

=== OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 is the industry standard authorization framework used to restrict and control access to protected resources using signed access tokens.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. In the *Security* section, next to *OAuth 2.0 authorization*, select image:icon_arrow.gif[blue arrow pointing to the right].
. Enable OAuth 2.0
. Select *Add configuration* and provide the configuration details.
