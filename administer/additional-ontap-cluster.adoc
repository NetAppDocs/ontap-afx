[.lead]
In addition to the typical AFX cluster administration, there may be other tasks you need to perform based on your environment. Most of the additional tasks can be performed using System Manager, although in some cases you may need to use the CLI.

[NOTE]
The ONTAP features and administration described are common to AFX storage systems and AFF or FAS systems running Unified ONTAP. Links to the relevant Unified ONTAP documentation are included as appropriate.

== Licensing

AFX systems are licensed in a similar way as Unified ONTAP AFF and FAS systems. An AFX cluster includes most features by default for the protocols supported. 

=== ONTAP license management

An ONTAP license is a record of one or more software entitlements. All licenses are defined and provided using a NetApp license file (NLF). See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/system-admin/manage-licenses-concept.html[ONTAP licensing overview^] for more information.

=== Install a license on an AFX storage system

You can install license files to activate additional features as needed for your AFX storage system.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. Next to *Licenses*, select image:icon_arrow.gif[blue arrow pointing to the right].
. Select the *Features* tab to display the available ONTAP features.
. To optionally install a licenses, select the *Installed licenses* tab.
. Select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters].
. Select a local license file and select *Add*.

== Security

There are several optional security features you can configure and use with your AFX deployment.

=== ONTAP security and data encryption

It's important to protect the security and priacy of your AFX storage system. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/security-encryption/index.html[Security and data encryption^]

=== ONTAP authentication and access control

The AFX storage system provides several options for configuring authentication and access control services. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/authentication-access-control/index.html[Authentication and access control^] for more information.

=== Administer OAuth 2.0 on an AFX storage system

OAuth 2.0 is the industry standard authorization framework used to restrict and control access to protected resources using signed access tokens.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. In the *Security* section, next to *OAuth 2.0 authorization*, select image:icon_arrow.gif[blue arrow pointing to the right].
. Enable OAuth 2.0
. Select *Add configuration* and provide the configuration details.
. Select *Save*.
