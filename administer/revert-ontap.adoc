Reverting an ONTAP cluster is the process of moving all the nodes to the previous major ONTAP release.

NetApp AFX storage systems do not support ONTAP revert. Attempting a revert operation with AFX can result in cluster instability and data loss. You should not attempt a revert operation on an AFX system.
