= Manage ONTAP AFX Ethernet ports
:icons: font

[.lead]
The ports used by ONTAP AFX provide the foundation for network connectivity and communication. There are several configuration options available to customize the layer two aspect of your network.

== Create a VLAN

A VLAN consists of switch ports grouped together into a broadcast domain.  VLANs enable you to increase security, isolate potential problems, and limit available paths within your IP network infrastructure.

.Before you begin

The switches deployed in the network must either comply with IEEE 802.1Q standards or have a vendor-specific implementation of VLANs.

.About this task

Note the following:

* You can't create a VLAN on an interface group port without any member ports.
//* A VLAN can’t be created on an interface group port that contains no member ports.
* When you configure a VLAN over a port for the first time, the port might go down, resulting in a temporary disconnection of the network. Subsequent VLAN additions to the same port do not affect the port state.
* You should not create a VLAN on a network interface with the same identifier as the native VLAN of the switch. For example, if the network interface e0b is on native VLAN 10, you should not create a VLAN e0b-10 on that interface.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Network* and then *Ethernet ports*.
. Select image:icon_vlan.png[a blue plus sign followed by the word vlan].
. Provide the configuration details, including the id, broadcast domain, and ports across the desired nodes.
+
The VLAN can’t be attached to a port hosting a cluster LIF or to ports assigned to the cluster IPspace.
. Select *Save*.

.Result

You have created a VLAN to increase security, isolate problems, and limit available paths within your IP network infrastructure.

== Create a LAG

A link aggregate group (LAG) is a technique that combines multiple physical network connections into a single logical connection. You can use it to increase the bandwidth and provide redundancy between nodes.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Network* and then *Ethernet ports*.
. Select image:icon_vlan.png[a blue plus sign followed by the word lag].
. Provide the configuration details, including the node, broadcast domain, ports, mode, and load distribution.
. Select *Save*.
