== Create a VLAN

A VLAN consists of switch ports grouped together into a broadcast domain.  VLANs enable you to increase security, isolate problems, and limit available paths within your IP network infrastructure.

.Before you begin

The switches deployed in the network must either comply with IEEE 802.1Q standards or have a vendor-specific implementation of VLANs.

.About this task

* A VLAN can’t be created on an interface group port that contains no member ports.
* When you configure a VLAN over a port for the first time, the port might go down, resulting in a temporary disconnection of the network. Subsequent VLAN additions to the same port do not affect the port state.
* You should not create a VLAN on a network interface with the same identifier as the native VLAN of the switch. For example, if the network interface e0b is on native VLAN 10, you should not create a VLAN e0b-10 on that interface.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Network > Ethernet ports*; then select image:icon_vlan.png[a blue plus sign followed by the word vlan].
. Select the node and broadcast domain for the VLAN.
. Select the port for the VLAN.
+
The VLAN can’t be attached to a port hosting a cluster LIF or to ports assigned to the cluster IPspace.  
. Enter a VLAN ID.
. Select *Save*.

.Result

You have created a VLAN to increase security, isolate problems, and limit available paths within your IP network infrastructure.
