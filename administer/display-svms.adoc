[.lead]
You can display and monitor the data storage VMs defined in your ONTAP AFX cluster. Each SVM provides an isolated environment when organizing your data and providing client access.

[TIP]
When you initially deploy an ONTAP AFX cluster there is always one default SVM created.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then *Storage VMs* in the navigation pane.

. Hover over the desired SVM and select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots] to view the administrative options.
