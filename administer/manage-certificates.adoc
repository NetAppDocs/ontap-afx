A digital certificate is an electronic document used to prove ownership of a public key. The public key and associated private key can be used to in various ways, including to establish identity typically as part of a larger security framework such as TLS and IPsec. These keys, as well as the supporting protocols and formatting standards, form the basis for public key infrastructure (PKI).
