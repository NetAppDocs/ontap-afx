Depending on your environment, you'll need to create and manage digital certificates as part of administering AFX. There are several related tasks you can perform.

== Generate a certificate signing request

To get started using a digital certificate, you need to generate a certificate signing request (CSR). A CSR is used to request a signed certificate from a certificate authority (CA).As part of this, ONTAP creates a public/private key pair and includes the public key in the CSR.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. Under *Security* and next to *Certificates*, select image:icon_arrow.gif[blue arrow pointing to the right]
. Select image:icon_generate_csr.png[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the words generate csr].
. Provide the subject common name and country; optionally provide the organization and organizational unit.
. To change the default values which will define the certificate, select image:icon_more_options.png[two arrows facing diagonally opposite directions followed by the words more options] and make the desired updates.
. Select *Generate*.

.Result

You have generated a CSR which can be used to request a public key certificate.

== Add a trusted certificate authority

ONTAP provides a default set of trusted root certificates for use with Transport Layer Security (TLS) and other protocols.  You can add additional trusted certificate authorities as needed.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. Under *Security* and next to *Certificates*, select image:icon_arrow.gif[blue arrow pointing to the right].
. Select the tab *Trusted certificate authorities* and then select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters].
. Provide the configuration information, including the name, scope, common name, type, and certificate details; you can import the certificate instead by selecting *Import*.
. Select *Add*.

.Result

You have added a trusted certificate authority to your AFX system.

== Renew or delete a trusted certificate authority

Trusted certificate authorities must be renewed annually.  If you do not want to renew an expired certificate, you should delete it.

.Steps

. Select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. Under *Security* and next to *Certificates*, select image:icon_arrow.gif[blue arrow pointing to the right].
. Select the tab *Trusted certificate authorities*.
. Select the trust certificate authority that you want to renew or delete.
. Renew or delete the certificate authority.
