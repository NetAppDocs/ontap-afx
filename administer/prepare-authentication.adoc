You need to prepare the authentication and authorization services used by the AFX system to define user accounts and roles.

== Configure LDAP

You can configure a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server to maintain authentication information at a central location.

.Before you begin

You must have generated a certificate signing request and added a CA-signed server digital certificate.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. Select image:icon_gear_white_bg.png[outline of a blue mechanical gear] next to *LDAP*.
. Select image:icon_add.gif[blue add with white background] and provide the name or IP address of the LDAP server.
. Provide the necessary configuration information, including the schema, base DN, port, and binding.
. Select *Save*.

== Configure SAML authentication

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication enables users to be authenticated by a secure identity provider (IdP) instead of providers using other protocols such as LDAP.

.Before you begin

* The identity provider you plan to use for remote authentication must be configured. See the provider documentation for configuration details.
* You must have the URI of the identity provider.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. Select image:icon_gear_white_bg.png[blue outline of a mechanical gear] under *Security* next to *SAML authentication*.
. Select *Enable SAML authentication*.
. Provide the *IdP URL* and the *Host system* IP address and select *Save*.
+
A confirmation window displays the metadata information, which has been automatically copied to your clipboard.
. Navigate to the IdP system you specified and copy the metadata from your clipboard to update the system metadata.
. Return to the confirmation window in System Manager and select *I have configured the IdP with the host URI or metadata*.
. Select *Logout* to enable SAML-based authentication.
+
The IdP system will display an authentication screen.
