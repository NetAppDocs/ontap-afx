You can use System Manager to prepare the authentication and authorization services needed to define user accounts and roles. This includes configuring active directory domain controller access, LDAP, and SAML.

[NOTE]
Each ONTAP user needs to have one role assigned. The role includes privileges and determines what the user is allowed to access and do.

== Configure active directory domain controller access

Configure active directory (AD) domain controller access for your cluster or storage VM so that you can enable AD account access.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. In the *Security* section under *Active Directory*, select *Configure*.

.What's next?

You can enable AD account access on your ONTAP AFX storage system.

== Configure LDAP

Configure a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server to centrally maintain user information for authentication. 

.Before you begin

You must have generated a certificate signing request and added a CA-signed server digital certificate.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. In the *Security* section next to *LDAP*, select image:icon_gear_white_bg.png[outline of a blue mechanical gear].
. Enter the necessary LDAP server and binding information and select *Save*.

.What's next?

You can now use LDAP for user information and authentication.

== Configure SAML authentication

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication allows users to be authenticated by a secure identity provider (IdP) instead of the providers such as Active Directory and LDAP.

.Before you begin

* The IdP that you plan to use for remote authentication must be configured. See the IdP documentation for configuration.
* You must have the URI of the IdP.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. Under *Security* next to *SAML authentication*, select image:icon_gear_white_bg.png[blue outline of a mechanical gear].
. Select *Enable SAML authentication*.
. Enter the IdP URL and the host system IP address and select *Save*.
+
A confirmation window displays the metadata information, which has been automatically copied to your clipboard.
. Navigate to the IdP system you specified and copy the metadata from your clipboard to update the system metadata.
. Return to the confirmation window in System Manager and select *I have configured the IdP with the host URI or metadata*.
. Select *Logout* to enable SAML-based authentication.
+
The IdP system will display an authentication screen.

.What's next?

You can now use SAML authentication for your user accounts.
