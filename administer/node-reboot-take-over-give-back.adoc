[.lead]
You might need to reboot a node for maintenance, troubleshooting, software updates or other administrative reasons.  When a node is rebooted, its HA partner automatically executes a takeover. The partner node then performs an automatic giveback after the rebooted node comes back online.

*=> DP: Must confirm AFX needs this topic. See EAP test 12.*

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster > Overview*.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots] next to the node you want to reboot; then select *Reboot*.
. Enter the reason you are rebooting the node; then select *Reboot*.
+
The reason you enter for the reboot is recorded in the system audit log.

.What's next?

While the node is being rebooted, its HA partner performs a takeover so that there is no interruption in data service.  When the reboot is complete, the HA partner performs a giveback.
