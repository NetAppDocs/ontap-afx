The REST API provided with AFX is based on the Unified ONTAP REST API. There are a number of changes which adapt it to the unique characteristics and capabilities of the AFX personality.

== Unsupported features

AFX is a high-performance NAS and S3 storage system. It enables clients to access data using NFS, SMB/CIFS, and S3. Because of this specialization, there are several unsupported features including:

* Metrocluster
* Storage area networking (SAN)
* Disk aggregates 

== Removed API endpoints

Several endpoints have been removed from the REST API corresponding to the unsupported features.
