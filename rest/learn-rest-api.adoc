[.lead]
The ONTAP AFX REST API is based on the REST API provided with the Unified ONTAP personality. There are a number of changes which adapt it to the unique characteristics and capabilities of the AFX personality.

== Unsupported features

ONTAP AFX is a high-performance NAS storage system. It enables clients to access data using NFS, SMB/CIFS, and S3. There are several unsupported features, including:

* Metrocluster
* Storage area networking (SAN)
* Disk aggregates 

== Removed API endpoints

Several endpoints have been removed from the REST API corresponding to the unsupported features.
