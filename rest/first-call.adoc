You can issue a simple curl command to get started using the AFX REST API and confirm its availability.

.About this task

AFX is one of three ONTAP personalities available from NetApp. You can issue a REST API call to determine the personality of your ONTAP cluster. You can also use System Manager and the CLI; see the FAQ page for details.

.Before you begin

In addition to having the curl utility available on your local workstation, you'll need the following:

* IP address or FQDN of the AFX system cluster management LIF
* ONTAP credentials for an account with authority to access the ONTAP REST API

.Steps

. Issue the following command at the CLI of your local workstation:
+
[source,curl]
curl --request GET \
"https://$FQDN_IP/api/cluster?fields=disaggregated,san_optimized" \
--user username:password

. Based on the response, determine the ONTAP personality as follows:
+
* If “disaggregated” is *true* and:
** If “san_optimized” is *false* the personality is AFX
** If “san_optimized” is *true* the personality is ASA r2
* If “disaggregated” is *false* the personality is Unified ONTAP
