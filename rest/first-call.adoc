[.lead]
You can issue a simple curl command to get started using the ONTAP AFX REST API and confirm its availability.

.About this task

ONTAP AFX is one of three distinct ONTAP personalities. You can use a call to the REST API to determine the ONTAP personality of your cluster based on two fields included in the response.

.Before you begin

In addition to having the curl utility available on your local workstation, you'll need the following:

* IP address or FQDN of the ONTAP AFX cluster management LIF
* ONTAP credentials for an account with authority to access the ONTAP REST API

.Steps

. Issue the following command at the CLI of your local workstation:
+
[source,curl]
curl --request GET \
"https://$FQDN_IP/api/cluster?fields=disaggregated,san_optimized" \
--user username:password

. Based on the response, determine the ONTAP personality as follows:
+
* If “disaggregated” is *true* and:
** If “san_optimized” is *false* the personality is ONTAP AFX
** If “san_optimized” is *true* the personality is ASA r2
* If “disaggregated” is *false* the personality is Unified ONTAP
