To install and configure your ONTAP AFX system, you need to review the hardware requirements, prepare your site, install and cable the hardware components, and power on the system.

After the equipment is installed, you need to set up the AFX cluster. Refer to link:../install-setup/cluster-setup.html[Set up your ONTAP AFX cluster] for details.
