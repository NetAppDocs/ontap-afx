[.lead]
Before managing your ONTAP AFX data, you should be familiar with the major concepts and capabilities.

[TIP]
Most of the concepts and procedures used for ONTAP AFX data security are the same as Unified ONTAP. Refer to <<Related information>> for more information including links to the applicable Unified ONTAP documentation.

== Terminology and options

There are several terms related to ONTAP AFX storage protection you should be familiar with.

Ransomware::
Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts files, making them inaccessible to the user, and which typically demands some type of payment for decryption of the data. NetApp ONTAP provides solutions to protect against ransomware through features like Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) and FPolicy.

Encryption::
Encryption is process of converting data into a secure format that cannot be easily read without proper authorization. ONTAP offers both software-based and hardware-based encryption technologies to protect data at rest. This ensures it cannot be read if the storage medium is repurposed, returned, misplaced, or stolen. These encryption solutions can be managed using either an external key management server or the Onboard Key Manager provided by ONTAP.
