You can encrypt your data at the hardware and software level for dual-layer protection. When you encrypt data at rest, it can’t be read if the storage medium is repurposed, returned, misplaced, or stolen.

NetApp Storage Encryption (NSE) supports hardware encryption using self-encrypting drives (SEDs).  SEDs encrypt data as it is written. Each SED contains a unique encryption key.  Encrypted data stored on the SED can’t be read without the SED's encryption key. Nodes attempting to read from an SED must be authenticated to access the SED's encryption key.  Nodes are authenticated by obtaining an authentication key from a key manager, then presenting the authentication key to the SED.  If the authentication key is valid, the SED will give the node its encryption key to access the data it contains.  

.Before you begin

Use the AFX onboard key manager or an external key manager to serve authentication keys to your nodes. In addition to NSE, you can also enable software encryption to add another layer of security to your data.

.Steps

. In System manager, select *Cluster* and then *Settings*.
. In the *Security* section, under *Encryption*, select *Configure*.
. Configure the key manager.
