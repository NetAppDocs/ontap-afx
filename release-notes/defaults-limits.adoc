There are several ONTAP defaults and limits that affect ONTAP AFX storage systems. You should be aware of the changes for your AFX release and how they might impact your deployment.

*---------- PLACEHOLDER MUST UPDATE ----------*

*=> DP: Will include this topic for the initial release to capture important limits, such as the number of nodes (8 nodes) and storage limit (2PB capacity). These limits will increase with ONTAP 9.18.1*
