[.lead]
You should be aware of how ONTAP AFX is similar to and different from Unified ONTAP. This provides a valuable perspective and can be helpful when deploying AFX in your environment.

== New platform built on Unified ONTAP

ONTAP AFX is initially based on the Unified ONTAP personality. Because of this, it includes a robust set of features and administrative options. If you're an experienced ONTAP user, you'll find it very easy to work with AFX. If you're new to ONTAP, the simplified System Manager user interface and streamlined administration will help you get started quickly.

== Configuration differences with Unified ONTAP

There are a few areas where the default AFX configuration differs from Unified ONTAP.

Advanced Capacity Balancing::
The advanced capacity balancing feature, as controlled using the `-gdd` CLI parameter, is enabled by default for all FlexGroup volumes.

== Unsupported or restricted Unified ONTAP capabilities

While the ONTAP AFX and Unified ONTAP personalities are very similar, there are several features that are not supported with AFX.
