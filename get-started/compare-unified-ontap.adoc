[.lead]
Comparing ONTAP AFX to Unified ONTAP provides a valuable perspective and can be helpful when evaluating AFX for your environment.

// Comment to reviewers:
[big red]*DP: Do we need to add a list of unsupported CLI commands? See the last section on this page.*

== New platform built on Unified ONTAP

ONTAP AFX is derived from the Unified ONTAP personality. Because of this, it includes a robust set of features and administrative options. If you're an experienced ONTAP user, you'll find it very easy to work with AFX. If you're new to ONTAP, the simplified System Manager user interface and streamlined administration will help you get started quickly.

There are several new and updated features available with ONTAP AFX. Review the related information for more details.
