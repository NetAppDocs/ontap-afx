[.lead]
You should be aware of how AFX systems are similar to and different than FAS and AFF systems running Unified ONTAP. This provides a valuable perspective and can be helpful when deploying AFX in your environment.

== Configuration differences with Unified ONTAP

There are a few areas where the AFX configuration differs from AFF and FAS systems. This is a result of the storage systems running two different ONTAP personalities.

Advanced Capacity Balancing::
The advanced capacity balancing feature, as controlled using the `-gdd` CLI parameter, is enabled by default for all FlexGroup volumes.

== Unsupported or restricted Unified ONTAP capabilities

While the AFX, AFF, and FAS storage systems are very similar, there are several features that are not supported with AFX.

[TIP]
You should review the updates and changes for AFX in the appropriate link:../release-notes/whats-new-9171.html[What's new] section based on your release.

The following features, organized in several categories, are not available or have changed with AFX.

=== General features

[big red]*DP: Chris will confirm whether to remove SnapLock from the list.*

* FabricPool
* SnapLock
* MetroCluster
* AI based anti-ransomware protection
* ONTAPI API (ZAPI)
//* Active IQ Unified Manager

=== SAN-related features

* SAN administration and client access
* Thick provisioned volumes

=== Aggregate-related features

The following aggregate-related features are not available with AFX:

* Direct access to disk aggregates
* NetApp Aggregate Encryption (NAE)
* Aggregate-level deduplication
* SyncMirror (aggregate mirroring)
* RAID management
// NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE) and self-encrypting volumes ARE supported

=== Data replication

* No replication of a volume from Unified ONTAP that contains a LUN
* FlexGroup volumes can only be replicated to ONTAP 9.16.1 or later

== Changes to the command line interface

The CLI available with AFX generally mirrors Unified ONTAP. But there are several differences, including:

* New AFX commands related to:
** Displaying the capacity of the storage availability zone
** Boot media

* No SAN-related commands 

* Aggregate management commands are no longer required

* FlexAggr commands can only display or show the FlexAggrs
