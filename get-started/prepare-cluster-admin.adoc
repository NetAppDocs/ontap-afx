= Prepare to administer ONTAP AFX
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
Before deploying ONTAP AFX in a production environment, it’s essential to understand the administrative structure and options. This will ensure secure, efficient, and effective management of your AFX cluster.

// Comment to reviewers:
[big red]*DP: In addition to AFX, this page also includes content that will be helpful for customers who are new to ONTAP.*

== Understand storage virtual machines

A storage virtual machine (SVM) is an isolated server or tenant environment within an ONTAP cluster. You can configure an SVM to serve data to the connected clients. You should be familiar with the capabilities and characteristics of the ONTAP AFX SVMs.

[NOTE]
One data SVM is created when you set up and initially deploy an ONTAP AFX cluster. You can create additional SVMs if needed.

.Administrative control

Data SVMs can be used to establish and enforce isolation of your data and applications. This can be useful when there are many different groups with a larger organization. Administrative control can be delegated to the SVMs to establish policies related to data access, security, and protection.

.Accounts and RBAC roles

It's important to note there are two levels of authentication and authorization with ONTAP AFX: cluster level and SVM level. In addition to the cluster accounts, every SVM has its own distinct set of users and roles. In most situations, using the cluster level accounts is adequate. But depending on your environment, you might need to configure and use the more restrictive SVM accounts and roles as well. See link:../administer/additional-ontap-svm.html[Additional ONTAP AFX SVM administration] for more information.

.SVM-scoped resources

ONTAP AFX resources and configurable entities are associated either with the cluster or a specific SVM. There are many resources with an SVM scope, including volumes and buckets as well as the SVM user accounts and RBAC roles.

.Dedicated network interfaces

Each SVM has its own dedicated set of network interfaces. For example, separate LIFs are allocated to an SVM for management and client data access.

== Two AFX administrative levels

The administrative tasks you perform with AFX generally fall into two different categories. Some tasks apply to the cluster as a whole, while other tasks apply to a specific SVM. This results in two-tier administrative model.

It's important to note that these levels describe how the administrative tasks are organized and assigned, and not necessarily how the associated security is configured. For example, while a cluster administrator account is needed to perform cluster level administration, it can also be used for SVM administration.

.Cluster administrator

The cluster administrator has complete control of the AFX cluster including all the data SVMs. However, for clarity this AFX administrative level includes only the tasks that a cluster admin can perform and not any of the SVM-specific administration tasks. See link:../administer/view-dashboard.html[Administer your cluster] for more information.

.SVM administrator

An SVM administrator has control of a specific data SVM and so is more restricted compared to the cluster administrator. SVM administration involves performing tasks with objects and resources that have an SVM scope, such as creating a volume. See link:../manage-data/prepare-provision-storage.html[Administer your storage VMs] for more information.

== Three administrative interfaces

As with the other ONTAP personalities (Unified, ASA r2), ONTAP AFX has three administrative interfaces. The LIF (or IP address) you need to use varies based on the administrative interface and your environment.

[NOTE]
The System Manager user interface is preferred for most administrative tasks. You should use an administrator account unless otherwise indicated.

|===
|Interface
|Description
|System Manager
|This is a graphical user interface available through a web browser. It's easy to use and provides access to most of the capabilities customers need. Accessing ONTAP AFX through System Manager is generally considered the preferred option.
|Command line interface
|The ONTAP CLI is accessible using SSH. Depending on your account, you can access the cluster management LIF or SVM management LIF. The CLI is more difficult to use but is more robust. It's preferred, and sometimes required, for advanced administration tasks.
|REST API
|ONTAP AFX includes a REST API you can use to automate the administration of your AFX cluster. The API is based on the Unified ONTAP REST API with modifications to support the unique AFX features and restrictions.

== Learn to search, filter, and sort information in System Manager

The System Manager user interface includes a robust set of features enabling you to access and display the information you need. Learning to use these capabilities will help you to better administer the ONTAP AFX storage system. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/task_admin_search_filter_sort.html[Search, filter, sort information in System Manager^] for more information.

== Access the ONTAP AFX CLI

While you can use System Manager for most ONTAP AFX administration, there are some tasks you can only perform using the ONTAP CLI.

.About this task

You can access the ONTAP AFX CLI through the secure shell (SSH). The CLI has two privilege levels that determine the commands and command parameters available to you. The `admin` level has the least privilege and is the default when you sign in. You can elevate the privilege of your session to `advanced` if needed.

.Before you begin

You'll need the following:

* IP address or domain name of the cluster or SVM management LIF
* Account credentials
* SSH client on your local workstation

.Steps

. Use SSH to connect to ONTAP AFX, for example:
+
`ssh admin@10.69.117.24`

. Provide the account password.

. Display the command directories at the top of the hierarchy:
+
`?`

== Confirm AFX system health

Before performing any ONTAP AFX administration tasks, you should check the health of the cluster.

[TIP]
You can check the health of your ONTAP AFX cluster at any time, including when you suspect an operational or performance issue.

.Before you begin

You'll need the following:

* Cluster management IP address or FQDN
* Administrator account for the cluster (username and password)

.Steps

. Connect to System Manager using a browser:
+
`\https://$FQDN_IPADDR/`
+
*Example*
+
`\https://10.61.25.33/`

. Provide the administrator username and password and select *Sign in*.

. Review the system dashboard and cluster status including cabling. Also notice the _navigation pane_ on the left.

. Display the system events and audit log messages.

. Display and note any *Insight* recommendations.

== Quick start for creating and using a data SVM

After installing and setting up the ONTAP AFX cluster, you can begin performing the administration tasks typical of most AFX deployments. Here are the high-level steps needed to begin sharing data with clients.

== References to additional documentation

NetApp offers ONTAP in three distinct personalities. Where appropriate, this ONTAP AFX documentation includes links to topics at the Unified ONTAP doc site. The additional information provides more depth and a different perspective that can be helpful as you administer your ONTAP AFX storage system.
