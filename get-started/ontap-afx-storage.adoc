The NetApp AFX storage system is based on a next‑generation storage architecture that evolves the ONTAP storage model into a disaggregated high-performance NAS solution. AFX supports both file and object workloads with advanced technologies and processing techniques that provide extremely high performance.

== Typical application workloads

AFX storage meets the unique demands typical of AI/ML environments and other related data-centric applications. The AFX storage system is ideal for organizations managing several different workloads including:

* Training and iterative model refinement associated with deep learning where continuous high bandwidth and access to massive datasets is required.
* Processing diverse data types including text, images, and video.
* Real‑time inference applications with low latency where strict response time windows are needed.
* Data science and machine learning pipelines that can benefit from self‑service data management by data engineers and data scientists.
* Workloads that require high concurrency and parallel I/O, such as multi‑GPU systems with RDMA transport.

== Hardware infrastructure

The NetApp AFX storage system delivers a unified hardware and software solution that creates a simplified experience specific to the needs of high-performance NAS customers.

The following hardware components are used with AFX clusters:

* AFX 1K controllers
* NX224 shelves
* Cisco Nexus 9332D-GX2B or Nexus 9364D-GX2A switches
