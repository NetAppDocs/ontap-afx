Snapshot replication is a process in which consistency groups on your AFX system are copied to a geographically remote location. After the initial replication, changes to consistency groups are copied to the remote location based upon a replication policy. Replicated consistency groups can be used for disaster recovery or data migration.

To set up Snapshot replication, you need to establish a replication relationship between your AFX storage system and the remote location. The replication relationship is governed by a replication policy.  A default policy to replicate all snapshots is created during cluster set up.  You can use the default policy or optionally, create a new policy.

== Step 1: Create a cluster peer relationship

Before you can protect your data by replicating it to a remote cluster, you need to create a cluster peer relationship between the local and remote cluster.

.Before you begin

The prerequisites for cluster peering are the same for AFX systems as for other ONTAP systems.  link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/peering/prerequisites-cluster-peering-reference.html[Review the prerequisites for cluster peering^].

.Steps

. On the local cluster, in System Manager, select *Cluster > Settings*.
. Under *Intercluster Settings* next to *Cluster peers* select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots], then select *Add a cluster peer*.
. Select *Lauch remote cluster*; this generates a passphrase you'll use to authenticate with the remote cluster.
. After the passphrase for the remote cluster is generated, paste it under *Passphrase* on the local cluster.
. Select image:icon_add.gif[blue plus sign followed by the word add in blue letters]; then enter the intercluster network interface IP address.
. Select *Initiate cluster peering*.

.What's next?

You have peered for local AFX cluster with a remote cluster.  You can now create a replication relationship.

== Step 2: Optionally, create a replication policy

The snapshot replication policy defines when updates performed on the AFX cluster are replicated to the remote site.  

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Policies*; then select *Replication policies*.
. Select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters].
. Enter a name for the replication policy or accept the default name; then enter a description.
. Select the *Policy scope*.
+
If you want to apply the replication policy to the entire cluster, select *Cluster*.   If you want the replication policy applied only to the volume in a specific storage VM, select *Storage VM*.
. Select the *Policy type*.

. Select *Save*.

.What's next?

You have created a replication policy and are now ready to create a replication relationship between your AFX system and your remote location.

== Step 3: Create a replication relationship

A snapshot replication relationship establishes a connection between your AFX system and a remote location so that you can replicate consistency groups to a remote cluster. Replicated consistency groups can be used for disaster recovery or for data migration. 

For protection against ransomware attacks, when you set up your replication relationship, you can select to lock the destination snapshots. Locked snapshots cannot be deleted accidentally or maliciously.  You can use locked snapshots to recover data if a volume is compromised by a ransomware attack.

.Before you begin

If you want to lock your destination snapshots, you must link:../secure-data/ransomware-protection.html#initialize-the-snaplock-compliance-clock[initialize the Snapshot compliance clock] before you create the replication relationship.

Create a replication relationship with or without locked destination snapshots.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Select a consistency group.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Protect*.
. Under *Remote protection*, select *Replicate to a remote cluster*.
. Select the *Replication policy*.

You must select a _vault_ replication policy.
. Select *Destination settings*.
. Select *Lock destination snapshots to prevent deletion*
. Enter the maximum and minimum data retention period.
. To delay the start of the data transfer, deselect *Start transfer immediately*.
+ 
The initial data transfer begins immediately by default.  
. Optionally, to override the default transfer schedule, select *Destination settings*, then select *Override transfer schedule*.
+
Your transfer schedule must be a minimum of 30 minutes to be supported.
. Select *Save*.

.Without locked snapshots

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Replication*.
. Select to create the replication relationship with local destination or local source.

.What's next?

Now that you have created a replication policy and relationship, your initial data transfer begins as defined in your replication policy.  You can optionally test your replication failover to verify that successful failover can occur if your AFX system goes offline.

== Step 4: Test replication failover

Optionally, validate that you can successfully serve data from replicated volumes on a remote cluster if the source cluster is offline.  

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Replication*.
. Hover over the replication relationship you want to test, then select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots].
. Select *Test failover*.
. Enter the failover information, then select *Test failover*.

.What's next?

Now that your data is protected with snapshot replication for disaster recovery, you should link:../secure-data/encrypt-data-at-rest.html[encrypt your data at rest] so that it can't be read if a disk in your AFX system is repurposed, returned, misplaced or stolen.
