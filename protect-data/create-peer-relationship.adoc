A peer relationship defines network connections that enable clusters and storage virtual machine (VM) to exchange data securely. You can create a peer relationship between storage VMs on different clusters to enable data protection and disaster recovery using SnapMirror.

.Before you begin

You must have established a cluster peer relationship between the local and remote clusters before you can create a storage VM peer relationship.  link:snapshot-replication.html#step-1-create-a-cluster-peer-relationship[Create a cluster peer relationship] if you have not already done so.
