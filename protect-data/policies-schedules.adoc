You can use snapshot policies to protect data in your consistency groups based on an automated schedule. The policy schedules within snapshot policies determine how often snapshots are taken.

== Create a new protection policy schedule

A protection policy schedule defines how often a snapshots policy is executed.  You can create schedules to run in regular intervals based on a number of days, hours, or minutes.  For example, you can create a schedule to run every hour or to run only once per day.  You can also create schedules to run at specific times on specific days of the week or month.  For example, you can create a schedule to run at 12:15am on the 20th of every month.  

Defining various protection policy schedules gives you the flexibility to increase or decrease the frequency of snapshots for different applications. This enables you to provide a greater level of protection and a lower risk of data loss for your critical workloads than what might be needed for less critical workloads.

.Steps

. Select *Protection* and then *Policies*; then select *Schedule*.
. Select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[a blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters].
. Enter a name for the schedule; then select the schedule parameters.
. Select *Save*.

.What's next?

Now that you have created a new policy schedule, you can use the newly created schedule within your policies to define when snapshots are taken. 

== Create a snapshot policy

A snapshot policy defines how often snapshots are taken, the maximum number of snapshots allowed, and how long snapshots are retained.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection* and then *Policies*; then select *Snapshot policies*.
. Select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters].
. Enter a name for the snapshot policy.
. Select *Cluster* to apply the policy to the entire cluster.  Select *Storage VM* to apply the policy to an individual storage VM.
. Select *Add a schedule*; then enter the snapshot policy schedule.
. Select *Add policy*.

.What's next?

Now that you have created a snapshot policy, you can apply it to a consistency group. Snapshots will be taken of the consistency group based on the parameters you set in your snapshot policy.


== Apply a snapshot policy to a consistency group

Apply a snapshot policy to a consistency group to automatically create, retain, and label snapshots of the consistency group.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection* and then *Policies*; then select *Snapshot policies*.
. Hover over the name of the snapshot policy you want to apply.  
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Apply*.
. Select the consistency groups to which you want to apply the snapshot policy; then select *Apply*.

.What's next?
Now that your data is protected with snapshots, you should link:snapshot-replication.html#step-3-create-a-replication-relationship[set up a replication relationship] to copy your consistency groups to a geographically remote location for backup and disaster recovery.

== Edit, delete, or disable a snapshot policy 

Edit a snapshot policy to modify the policy name, maximum number of snapshots, or the SnapMirror label.  Delete a policy to remove it and its associated back up data from your cluster.  Disable a policy to temporarily stop the creation or transfer of snapshots specified by the policy.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection* and then *Policies*; then select *Snapshot policies*.
. Hover over the name of the snapshot policy you want to edit.  
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Edit*, *Delete*, or *Disable*.

.Result

You have modified, deleted or disabled the snapshot policy.

== Edit a replication policy

Edit a replication policy to modify the policy description, transfer schedule, and rules.  You can also edit the policy to enable or disable network compression.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection* and then *Policies*.
. Select *Replication policies*.
. Hover over the replication policy that you want to edit; then select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots].
. Select *Edit*.
. Update the policy; then select *Save*.
