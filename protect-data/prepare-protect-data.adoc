[.lead]
Before protecting your ONTAP AFX data, you should be familiar with some of the key concepts and current status of your storage.

[TIP]
Most of the concepts and procedures used for ONTAP AFX data protection are the same as Unified ONTAP. Review the resources available in <<Related information>> for more information including the applicable Unified ONTAP documentation.

== Terminology and options

There are several terms related to ONTAP AFX data protection you should be familiar with.

Snapshot::
A snapshot is a read-only, point-in-time image of a volume. It is a foundational technology for ONTAP's replication and data protection services.

Consistency group::
A consistency group is a collection of volumes that can be managed as a single unit. You can create consistency groups to simplify storage management and data protection for application workloads. For example, you can snapshot several volumes in one operation by using the consistency group instead of the individual volumes.
